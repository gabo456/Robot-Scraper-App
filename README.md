This mobile application is designed to monitor and control an automated robot scraper used in poultry farms for cleaning chicken manure. The app provides real-time updates on the robot’s status, including cleaning schedules, battery levels, bins filles, and operation history. Users can start or stop the robot remotely, receive alerts for upcoming cleaning tasks, and track performance over time—improving hygiene, reducing manual labor, and maintaining farm efficiency.
# CHICKEN MANURE ROBOT SCRAPER MONITORING APP

Poultry farming is a vital industry that contributes significantly to food supply and agricultural income. However, one of the most persistent challenges faced by poultry farmers is the effective management of waste, particularly chicken manure. Accumulated manure can lead to poor sanitation, foul odors, and health risks for both animals and workers. Traditionally, cleaning is done manually, which is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and exposes workers to hazardous environments.

With the advancement of automation and smart technologies, integrating robotics into agricultural processes has become increasingly viable. This project aims to address the sanitation issue through the development of a Chicken Manure Robot Scraper Monitoring App—a mobile application that allows farmers to remotely monitor and control an automated cleaning robot within poultry facilities.

The robot is responsible for scraping and collecting manure based on scheduled intervals. The companion app enhances its functionality by providing real-time monitoring of the robot’s status, battery level, waste bin capacity, and scheduled cleaning tasks. It also offers remote control options, automated alerts, and historical data tracking, making farm management more efficient, hygienic, and data-driven.

By leveraging automation and mobile technology, this project supports modern poultry operations in reducing manual labor, improving cleanliness, and promoting a healthier environment for livestock—ultimately contributing to increased productivity and sustainability in agriculture.
